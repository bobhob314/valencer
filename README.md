# valencer
## Version 1.5 out now!
### Wow!
A blazing-fast, lightweight ... just kidding haha. A text interpreter that helps you memorize chemical valences.

If you don't have **Python 3.4** installed, just click `Run` [here](https://repl.it/CB7n/1) to run the program, typing your answers/commands in the simulated console on the right. (It should be black.)

**Instructions:** Type `QUIT` to quit, `SKIP` to skip and one or two space-separated numbers (without a `+` sign) to represent the valence(s) of an element.
